# Spam-mail-detection

This project is designed to classify emails as either spam or not spam using a machine learning approach. A Logistic Regression model is trained on a dataset of emails, with text features extracted using TfidfVectorizer. The model analyzes the email content and predicts whether it is spam based on the learned patterns. This solution helps automate the process of filtering out unwanted emails.
